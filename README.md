# Description

[`Container`](https://github.com/Kovnir/PlayQ-test-task/blob/master/Container.cs) is a class with the looped double linked list of random bool values. You can get and change a value of the current element, move to the next element or the previous one. 

## Task

1) Create an algorithm to find the number of nodes in the list. After the search, all values should remain in the original state. You don't have to modify `Container` class. Take care about performance and memory allocation. Ð¡ode should be covered with comments.
2) Create a Unit Test for it.
3) Visualize looped list as infinite scroll view in the new [Editor Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorWindow.html) as shown below. `Create new` button should create new `Container` instance with random node count.
